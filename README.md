**🏡 Housing Price Prediction**

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting housing prices using various features in the dataset. The project leverages Python, with data preprocessing and exploratory analysis performed using pandas and matplotlib, followed by building regression models using scikit-learn.

**📌 Project Overview**

The goal is to create a predictive model that can estimate housing prices based on various input features like square footage, location, number of bedrooms, etc. This type of predictive modeling is commonly used in the real estate industry to assist in property valuation.
